            <h2>Project Overview</h2>
            <p>
            This project is developed as a semester project for the Data Base course. It implements ShopFinder that is an Android application . The application is designed to help users efficiently find and manage shops located in various visiting places. Users can search for shops either by their name or by the name of the visiting palace. For example, users can find all shops named <strong>Bata</strong> or all shops located in <strong>Anarkali</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The application supports two types of accounts:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Shopkeepers:</strong> They can add multiple shops to specific visiting places, manage and edit shop details, and view information about their shops.</li>
            <li><strong>Users:</strong> They can search for shops, view detailed information about each shop, rate them, and leave comments.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The application includes features for managing shop listings and searching for shops based on various criteria.
        </p>

<h2>Database Handler</h2>
<p>
    A key component of this project is the <code>DBHandler</code> class, which manages all database operations within the application. The <code>DBHandler</code> class extends <code>SQLiteOpenHelper</code> and plays a crucial role in the application's functionality by handling database creation, schema management, and data operations.
</p>

<h3>Key Features of <code>DBHandler</code>:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Database Creation:</strong> The <code>onCreate</code> method initializes the database schema by creating tables for shops and visiting places. It sets up essential constraints and relationships between tables to ensure data integrity.</li>
    <li><strong>Database Upgrades:</strong> The <code>onUpgrade</code> method handles schema changes and upgrades. It ensures that existing data is preserved and appropriately migrated when the database schema evolves.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Insertion:</strong> Methods such as <code>insertIntoVisitingPlaces</code> and <code>insertShop</code> are responsible for adding new records to the database. These methods validate input data and handle any necessary checks before inserting new entries.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Retrieval:</strong> The class includes methods like <code>getAllShops</code> and <code>getShopByName</code>, which retrieve data based on specific criteria. This functionality allows users and shopkeepers to query the database efficiently.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Management:</strong> The <code>DBHandler</code> class provides methods for updating and deleting records, ensuring that changes to shop or visiting place details are reflected in the database seamlessly.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Overall, the <code>DBHandler</code> class is central to the ShopFinder application, facilitating robust interaction with the SQLite database and maintaining the integrity and consistency of the application's data.
